		create a class that takes in inputs

	phase 2: create game loop and add inputs to it
		thread that refress screen every 60 frames per second
		add the inputs in this class

	phase 3: add gameobject

		this should be the singleplayer mode with one player and map where player cannot go out of bounds

	/*					completion

		this marks the completion of the actual phase 1.
		when we run the code the game runs with a players t
		hat runs around the map and cant get through the map
	*/

        


2. AFter game runs with map but limited to singleplayer

	phase 1: DB Table
		table with player name and id
		player use their existing account to save their game items
		players have to create a new account to playe game

	Phase 2: creating interface for new and old players
		use a game image as background
		create a window for new and old players (login and new player)
		create a pannel for login
		create a pannel for new player
		create a game menu pannel

	Phase 3:  add login and new player authentication using database
		create a new package for jdbc
		class that can add players, check playerid and name for login and new player
		/*   
			note: new players cant use old players name
			logic:
			if every player have a different name we can append a rand number to those names meaning every
			playerid is unique
		*/

	Phase 4-5: implement jdbc logic and game enter logic upto gamemenu
		focus on game menu:
			single player
			multiplayer
			inventory
			exit
			logout
		focus only on these 5, priotity is order based

	/*					completion

		this marks the completion of the actual phase 2.
		now when we run the code the game a login page pop up 
		login-> need to enter your playerid to enter game
		register-> enter your name if name exists add something to your name then enter game
			game menu:
				single player -> runs game
				multi player -> runs same game 
				inventory -> nohing
				exit -> exits game
				logout -> sends you to old or new player
	*/




3. implement multiplayer 

	phase 1: add a new package socket and create server and client
		create a new server class that creates a clienthandler for each clients
		create a new clent class that sends players location

	phase 3: client logic
		sends player location with pos in fornt of it
		/*		pos|x|y		*/

	Phase 3-4: create a clienthandler and its logic
		use static to add client in the lists
		it accepts clients and check message if its initail character is pos then its position
		send the player location to all the players in the list

	/*					completion

		this marks the completion of the actual phase 3.
		now when we run the code the game a login page pop up 
		login-> need to enter your playerid to enter game
		register-> enter your name if name exists add something to your name then enter game
			game menu:
				single player -> runs game
				multi player -> runs multiplayer mode
				inventory -> nohing
				exit -> exits game
				logout -> sends you to old or new player
	*/

	
4. implement jdbc in server

	phase 1: combine the socket and jdbc
		add jdbc code in socket package
		now the clienthandler will handle the jdbc connection and login and register
	
	phase 2-3: add login,register logic and add connecting in the pannel
		now the client will send playerid with login keyword and player name with name keyword
		/*   login|playerid		*/
		/*   name|playername		*/
		extract id or name form the clent message
		same logic that check the name with database and
		hanndle the wrong name,id and server error by send msg with distint keyword

	/*					completion

		this marks the completion of the actual phase 4.
		now when we run the code the game a login page pop up 
		login-> need to enter your playerid to enter game
		register-> enter your name if name exists add something to your name then enter game
			game menu:
				single player -> runs game
				multi player -> runs multiplayer mode
				inventory -> nohing
				exit -> exits game
				logout -> sends you to old or new player

		same but the login and resister auth is done in server
		now we have a multiplayer game with better security
